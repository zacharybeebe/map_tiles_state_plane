For this demonstration we are using a virtual environment with Python 3.10
If you are also using Python 3.10 on a 64 bit machine you can pip install the provided wheel for GDAL

    pip install GDAL-3.4.2-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl

If you are using a different version of Python or a 32 bit machine, download the GDAL wheel corresponding
to your Python version number and bit size from this repository: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

The Python version corresponds to the cpXXX number in the wheel filename. For 32 bit the end of the filename
will be win32 and for 64 bit it will be win_amd64.

For example:
Python 3.8 32-bit = GDAL-3.4.2-cp38-cp38-win32.whl
Python 3.8 64-bit = GDAL-3.4.2-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl

    pip install <GDAL filename>
